## MNE-Python Workshop
[MNE-Pyhton](https://github.com/mne-tools) is an open-source Python package used for the analysis of signals recorded from the head and the body (i.e. EEG, MEG, ECoG, etc.). In this conference, we gave a presentation for delving into mne-python for EEG signal processing.

<br> Tehran Garden took place in the [Convergent Technologies Research Center](https://utnbic.ir/en) located at the university of Tehran.</br>

This repository contains the slides and notebooks that I've prepared for this presentation.
The notebooks were originally cloned from the [mne workshop in Amsterdam](https://github.com/jona-sassenhagen/mne_workshop_amsterdam).
Then customized for our purposes.
