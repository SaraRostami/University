# University
This repository contains my activities as a Master's student, Teaching Assistant and Research Assistant at the university.
- Most of these courses I took have two main parts: Assignments and Project(s). In the Assignments folder of each course, there is a separate folder for each assignment and inside these folders, the following files exist: Problem_set file, dataset file(s), solution code file(s), and solutions' report file.
- My presentations are included in this repository.
- My contributions as a TA are also included.

## CuttingGardens Conference - Fall 2023
[CuttingGardens](https://cuttinggardens2023.org/) is a distributed conference on cutting-edge methods for M/EEG data analysis. It happens simultaneously in several locations (aka. Gardens) across the world, with a common global program, broadcasted to all locations, and local programs made of talks, tutorials, posters, social events, satellites,... as each Garden (optionally) sees fit. CuttingGardens is part of the [CuttingEEG](https://cuttingeeg.org/) conference series. 
My lab mate and I were in charge of the MNE Python toolbox presentation.
This is the [link](https://cuttinggardens2023.org/gardens/tehran/) to our presentation schedule in Tehran Garden.
