# University
This repository contains the homework and projects that I've done for the university courses.
most of these courses have two main parts: Assignments and Project(s).
In the Assignments folder of each course, there is a separate folder for each assignment and inside these folders, the following files exist: Problem_set file, dataset file(s), solution code file(s), and solutions' report file.
